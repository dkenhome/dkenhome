# About me

I am a sophomore at Texas A&M studying petroleum engineering. I will be the third generation in the oil industry on one side of the family and the third generation in engineering on the other side.

As a homeschool student, I enjoyed math and studied it multiple hours a day. It was necessary to be independent so I developed the skills needed to problem solve and seek help from mentors, including the author of my textbook.

While I spent the 2022/23 school year working part-time for a Homeschool Supplemental Educational Program, during the summers I took classes that accelerated my college career. Using the skills from when I was a homeschooler, I worked to get two semesters of chemistry and one of physics done in a single summer, finishing with a 3.67 GPA. Learning about the practical applications of chemistry and physics inspired me to study on my own time and led to my choice of petroleum engineering.
