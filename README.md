# About me

I am a junior at Texas A&M studying Petroleum Engineering, proudly continuing a family legacy in the oil industry and engineering. My background fostered independence, self-discipline, and a passion for problem-solving, allowing me to excel academically and accelerate my college career.

As a Student Technician at a lab in the Harold Vance Department of Petroleum Engineering, I learned not only the basics of handling drilling fluid but also some electrical and computer skills.

I have experience directing and assisting in Shakespearean plays, promoting teamwork and creativity. I have also contributed to my community by co-founding a young adult group at my church and serving as a senior altar server.

With a strong academic and practical foundation, along with a rich family heritage in the industry, I am excited to learn more about the industry and advance my career.
